# Deploy-a-Chatbot-using-Python

In this project, let's build and deploy a very simple Artificial Intelligent Chatbot. We will use the flask method to deploy the chatbot and the chatterbot package in python to build a chatbot. For building and deploying a chatbot successfully you should be familiar with flask and HTML frameworks. Yes obviously, you should be very good with Python and most importantly the Chatterbot library in python to build this AI chatbot.

### What is a Chatbot? How to Deploy a Chatbot?
A Chatbot is a computer program which is programmed to interact with a human. A chatbot is designed to reply to a human user based on their queries and conversations. If you think chatbots are a new technology, you’re wrong. The first chatbot, Eliza, was built in 1966 at MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum to mimic human conversations.

Now, before we build and deploy a chatbot, you should know what the chatterbot library is, as we will use this library for building our chatbot.

### What is the Chatterbot Library in Python?
Chatterbot is a Python library that generates responses for users. It uses a lot of pre-trained machine learning algorithms to give a variety of responses. It’s easy to create chatbots using the chatterbot library in Python. The chatbot should be designed to be language-independent. He must be trained in several languages. The chatbot is made up of data provided by the user.

### How to Deploy a Chatbot?
In python, we have Flask, which is useful in the tasks of web development of any program.

As we are going to deploy chatbot as a web application, so it is not possible to deploy it without the use of HTML and CSS as these two are the primary packages when it comes to the tasks of web development.
